# About Text-Fabric

Text-Fabric is a powerful Python library and framework designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. Text-Fabric was developed by [Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda). The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).

The main functionalities of Text-Fabric include:

* **Data Conversion:** Text-Fabric allows users to convert and import various text formats (e.g., XML, CSV, plain text) into a unified, efficient data format optimized for large-scale text analysis.

* **Data Organization:** Text-Fabric organizes the textual data into a graph-like data model. This data model represents the text as a network of interconnected nodes, where nodes can represent words, phrases, sentences, or any other linguistic unit, and edges represent relationships between these units.

* **Text Annotation:** It enables users to add annotations or metadata to the text, providing additional information about the linguistic units, such as part-of-speech tags, lemma, morphological data, or any other attributes relevant to the analysis.

* **Querying and Filtering:** Text-Fabric allows users to perform complex queries and filters on the text data. These queries enable researchers to extract specific linguistic patterns, search for particular words or phrases, or find instances that match certain criteria.

* **Computational Analysis:** The library supports a wide range of computational linguistic operations, such as concordance analysis, collocation analysis, frequency distributions, and other statistical analyses to gain insights into the text.

* **Interoperability:** Text-Fabric provides seamless integration with other popular Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, or NetworkX, enabling users to leverage additional data analysis capabilities.

* **Exporting and Serialization:** After analyzing the data, Text-Fabric allows users to export the results into various formats or serialize the processed data for future use.

# About this dataset

This repository belongs to a set of repositorie dedicated to storing the code and data generated for the 'Nestle 1904 Text-Fabric conversion project', a collaboration between [ETCBC](https://github.com/ETCBC) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) and [CBLC](https://github.com/CenterBLC) (Andrews University). 

The project comprises various TextFabric presentations of the Nestle 1904 version of the Greek New Testament, including:
* [https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904GBI](https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904GBI)
* [https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904LFT](https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904LFT)
* [https://github.com/saulocantanhede/tfgreek2](https://github.com/saulocantanhede/tfgreek2)

Each version uses a different conversion method, resulting in a distinct set of features. The final stable product is planned to be stored at:
* [https://github.com/ETCBC/nestle1904](https://github.com/ETCBC/nestle1904)

# Differences between datasets

The Text-Fabric datasets differ from each other in terms of the amount of syntactical information included. This can easily been seen by comparing the way they present text, grammar and syntax. The following two images show the graphical presentation of John 1:1.

# Text-Fabric version of the Greek New Testament (GBI)

This Github repository houses a comprehensive dataset for the Greek New Testament (Nestle 1904), enabling  linguistic and textual analytics through the Python package [Text-Fabric](tf.md). This dataset is [one of the datasets](about.md) created as part of the conversion of Eberhard Nestle's 1904 Greek New Testment (British Foreign Bible Society 1904) into TextFabric dataformat. Input to these conversions are the XML node files representing the macula-greek, formatted according to Syntax diagram markup by the Global Bible Initiative (GBI). The source data for this Text-Fabric version was the GBI XML. The most recent source data can be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek/tree/main/Nestle1904/nodes).

See [here](https://archive.org/details/the-greek-new-testament-nestle-1904-us-edition/mode/2up) a scan of the orginal publication: Nestle, Eberhard. Η Καινή Διαθήκη Novum Testamentum Graece (New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1904).
